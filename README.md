### About:

This is just a fun little project to help me learn how to use C++ better and properly utilize the raylib library.

I don't plan to make a complete game out of this (nor could I honestly, what with Nintendo's lawyers always dropping the hammer on people), but it's definitely going to be a fun project.

Feel free to fork it if you want, I don't really care. This is just something to play around with.
